## One of my first dives into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript gets a repo!
This project was started a long time ago when I decided I needed a portfolio to showcase anything I've learned. This code is riddled with mistakes as I was (and still am) learning about web development.

#### One thing I would like to point out is that all the visuals were created by me in Adobe Illustrator to help add a more personal style to the site (this is an intro to me, afterall!). I'm proud of the fact that this is an original design.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did creating it! :)
